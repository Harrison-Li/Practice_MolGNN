# Practice_GNN4MOL

This repository is my practice project focused on applying Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to molecular property prediction.



Compared to using SMILES strings or ECFP molecular fingerprints, GNNs offer a more robust way to capture the hidden molecular structure correlation by directly modeling atoms and bonds as nodes and edges in a graph. This graph representation allows GNN to better learn  chemical properties from molecular data.
